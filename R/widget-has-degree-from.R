#' Academic widgets
#'
#' Find entities who graduated with a particular major(s) or from a particular
#' school(s). By default, attendees are not included, use \code{attendees = TRUE}
#' to include attendees. If no majors/schools are entered, the widget will look
#' for anyone with a Cal degree (or if \code{attendees = TRUE}, anyone who has
#' attended Cal). Will not retrieve anyone with non-Berkeley degrees.
#'
#' @return A definition of type \code{entity_id}
#'
#' @param ... Schools/majors
#' @param undergraduates TRUE/FALSE: should include undergraduates? Default is TRUE
#' @param graduates TRUE/FALSE: should include graduates? Default is TRUE
#' @param attendees TRUE/FALSE: should include attendees? Default is FALSE
#' @param current_students TRUE/FALSE: should include current students? Default is FALSE
#' @param degreeholders TRUE/FALSE: should include degreeholders? Default is TRUE
#' @param from (optional) date range: look only for those who graduated between
#' these dates. Enter as an integer of the form YYYYMMDD (see details)
#' @param to (optional) date range: look only for those who graduated between
#' these dates. Enter as an integer of the form YYYYMMDD (see details)

#' @details
#' Note that some major and minor codes start with numbers and include letters
#' (for example: a minor in mathematics is coded as \code{25I071U}). This causes
#' errors when parsing. To get around the issue, either use quotation marks
#' explicitly (as in: \code{minored_in("25I071U")}) or use the synonym
#' (\code{minored_in(mathematics)})
#'
#' When using the daterange (\code{from} and/or \code{to}), the dates will be
#' based on the GRAD DATE for degreeholders and the STOP DATE for attendees
#' (who have no GRAD DATE). Both dates are visible in the Degrees screen in
#' Advance. An alum's "class year" is based on the GRAD DATE. For degreeholders,
#' the two dates are often the same, though they can differ. See examples below.
#' Date options are ignored when looking for current students
#'
