}
\description{
Find entities who graduated with a particular major(s) or from a particular
school(s). By default, attendees are not included, use \code{attendees = TRUE}
to include attendees. If no majors/schools are entered, the widget will look
for anyone with a Cal degree (or if \code{attendees = TRUE}, anyone who has
attended Cal). Will not retrieve anyone with non-Berkeley degrees.
}
\details{
Note that some major and minor codes start with numbers and include letters
(for example: a minor in mathematics is coded as \code{25I071U}). This causes
errors when parsing. To get around the issue, either use quotation marks
explicitly (as in: \code{minored_in("25I071U")}) or use the synonym
(\code{minored_in(mathematics)})

When using the daterange (\code{from} and/or \code{to}), the dates will be
based on the GRAD DATE for degreeholders and the STOP DATE for attendees
(who have no GRAD DATE). Both dates are visible in the Degrees screen in
Advance. An alum's "class year" is based on the GRAD DATE. For degreeholders,
the two dates are often the same, though they can differ. See examples below.
Date options are ignored when looking for current students

\examples{
## majored in philosophy and/or math between 2001 and 2004
## since attendees are not included by default, this only pulls
## (undergrad and grad) degreeholders. Those with a GRAD DATE in the
## daterange will be included
majored_in(mathematics, philosophy, from = 20010101, to = 20041231)

## just math grad degree holders
majored_in(mathematics, undergraduates = FALSE)

## here we pull graduate degreeholders and graduate attendees
## neither ungrad degreeholders nor undergrad attendees will be included
majored_in(mathematics,
           undergraduates = FALSE,
           graduates = TRUE,
           attendees = TRUE)

## evening/wknd program (haas) people are coded as attendees. note that since
## we're only looking at attendees here, we'll be using the STOP DATE
## this will pull BOTH undergrad and grad attendees, but no degreeholders
has_degree_from(haas, attendees = TRUE, degreeholders = FALSE
                from = 20010101, to = 20041231)

## current MBA students
has_degree(MBA, current_students = TRUE, degreeholders = FALSE)
